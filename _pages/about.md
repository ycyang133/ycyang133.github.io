I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 2018 and 2021, respectively, from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), Xi’an, China. I am currently a Ph.D. student of information and communication engineering with the Center of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications, NPU, Xi’an, China, and a Visiting Ph.D. student with Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan. My research interests include array signal processing, speech enhancement, blind source separation, and machine learning.
